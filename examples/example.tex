\chapter{Normal Equations}

It should be emphasized that for systems in which the inputs are known ahead of time and in which there are no disturbances it is advisable to use open-loop control.  Closed-loop control systems have advantages only when unpredictable disturbanc and/or unpredictable variations in system components are present. Note that the  output power rating partially determines the cost,weight,and size of a control system.  The number of components used in a closed-loop control system is more than that for  a corresponding open-loop control system. Thus, the closed-loop control system is  generally higher in cost and power.To decrease the required power of a system,open-  loop control may be used where applicable.A proper combination of open-loop and  closed-loop controls is usually less expensive and will give satisfactory overall system  performance

\begin{equation}
\alpha=R_{C} + \frac{\beta_{}}{\theta} \, \psi

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\alpha &= R_{C} + \frac{\beta_{}}{\theta} \cdot \psi\\
 &= 5 \cdot R_{c}\\
 &= 69\\
