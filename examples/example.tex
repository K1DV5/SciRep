\chapter{First Chapter}

It should be emphasized that for systems in which the inputs are known ahead of time and in which there are no disturbances it is advisable to use open-loop control.  Closed-loop control systems have advantages only when unpredictable disturbanc and/or unpredictable variations in system components are present. Note that the  output power rating partially determines the cost,weight,and size of a control system.  The number of components used in a closed-loop control system is more than that for  a corresponding open-loop control system. Thus, the closed-loop control system is  generally higher in cost and power.To decrease the required power of a system,open-  loop control may be used where applicable.A proper combination of open-loop and  closed-loop controls is usually less expensive and will give satisfactory overall system  performance.

The number of components used in a closed-loop control system is more than that for  a corresponding open-loop control system. Thus, the closed-loop control system is  generally higher in cost and power.
 $L_M = \pi\times \frac{\theta}{56}$

Note that the  output power rating partially determines the cost,weight,and size of a control system.  The number of components used in a closed-loop control system is more than that for  a corresponding open-loop control system. Thus, the closed-loop control system is  generally higher in cost and power.\\
