todo:
1.	add a plot capability (matplotlib)
2.	add a table capability
3.	add documentation

problems:
1.	beta is mestaken, use beta_ instead
2.	the unit psi is mistaken for the greek letter, assign it to another variable and work with it
3.	can't use modules imported as "import ... as ..." directly, use above method
4.	units cannot be used with numpy matrices, use sympy matrices instead
